In supervised learning, there are a couple of methods/algorithms to have classification.
Sklearn has its own data sets, and one of them is Iris Dataset.
This data set has 150 samples with 4 features which are 'sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', and 'petal width'.
By using K-Nearest_Neighbours (KNN) where the number of neighbors is set to 1 and Train-Test split, the model works with an accuracy of 0.97.
Codes committed to this repository have the plotting functions, train-test split functions and predictions with score.
Enjoy :)
